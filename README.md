# batteryswitch
small hacked script to switch discharging batterys on tinkpads running linux

## problem-description
i have two batterys in my a275 and the external battery has to be completely dead before my notebook switches to the internal.
obviously thats not very good for batterylife, so i decided to want them to switch before running completely empty.
unfortunatly thats apparantly not exactly easy (more in the category very hard) if you are running a linux. there are tools for windows which, at least the internet says so, are capable of changing the settings in the firmware or something, so that the settings from windows will get used when running linux, but... i never started windows so i wouldnt know.
however. as always this is going to be a really dirty hack so again (as with the display hack) i encourage you to not use this unless you are really desperate (as i am). and even then you should at least know a litte bit of the stuff you are going to do, following the "instructions" given here.
## if you have a better solution please contact me, i am aware that this is going to be absolutely horrific
